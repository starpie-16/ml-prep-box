# 📊 ML-Prep-Box
**Simplify data cleaning with automated strategies mapped to your data types.**

---

### 📝 Project Overview
An automated, **metadata-driven** data preparation toolbox designed to streamline preprocessing workflows by analyzing data characteristics. 

> **Focus:** Currently benchmarked and optimized for **basic tabular data**.

The project features:
* **Automated Type Inference:** Detecting numeric, categorical, and datetime features.
* **Statistical Intelligence:** Integrated skewness and outlier detection (IQR method).
* **Smart Strategy Mapping:** Automated selection of Imputation, Scaling (Standard vs. Robust), and Encoding based on data distribution.

---

### 🛠 System Architecture
The toolbox follows a modular, hybrid architecture:
* **Core Engine:** A wrapper class for seamless user interaction.
* **Utility Layer:** Decoupled functional logic in `utils.py` for high-performance statistical calculations.
* **Plugin System:** Extensible registry for custom transformation modules.

## 📊 Datasets

This project uses the following datasets for testing and demonstration:

| Dataset | Source | Description | Path |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Titanic** | [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) | Binary classification for survival prediction. | `data/raw/titanic.csv` |

> **Note:** All raw datasets are stored in `dataset/raw/`. The processed versions after running the `toolbox` will be saved in `dataset/processed/`.


---


## 🧪 Validation & Demo
We verified the DataWise engine using the Titanic dataset. The engine successfully generated optimal preprocessing strategies for mixed data types:
  Scaling: Applied to PassengerId, Age, Fare.
  Encoding: Automatically mapped for Name, Sex, Ticket, Embarked.
  Status: Zero errors found in the final transformation pipeline.

## 🧪 Benchmarking & Validation Framework

To ensure the stability, reliability, and precision of the automated pipeline, the toolbox undergoes continuous "stress testing" using diverse real-world datasets.

### 1. Data Sources & Provenance
We benchmark the pipeline against high-variance datasets to ensure cross-domain compatibility:
* **PyCaret Dataset Library:** Standardized sets such as `juice` (mixed types), `diabetes` (numeric), and `credit` (imbalanced classes).
* **UCI Machine Learning Repository:** Classic classification and regression benchmarks (e.g., Adult Census, Wine Quality).
* **Open-source Raw Data (Kaggle):** Testing against uncurated data with high noise levels, complex formatting, and inconsistent schemas.

### 2. Performance Key Results (KPIs)
A transformation is considered successful only if it meets the following criteria:
* **Data Integrity:** Zero unintended row loss; row counts must remain constant unless explicit 'drop' actions are triggered.
* **Schema Accuracy:** One-hot encoded columns must strictly match the unique categories identified during the analysis phase.
* **Null-Value Clearance:** 100% elimination of `NaN` values post-imputation across all features.
* **Production Readiness:** Transformer objects (Scalers, Encoders) must be state-managed to handle "Unseen Data" during inference without crashing or schema mismatch.

### 3. Bug Tracking & Versioning Strategy
Every edge case or failure identified during testing follows a strict resolution cycle:
1. **Detection:** Log the specific traceback and the dataset characteristics that triggered the fault.
2. **Patching:** Refactor logic within `processors.py` or `utils.py` to handle the exception gracefully.
3. **Regression Testing:** Re-running previous successful benchmarks to ensure new patches do not break existing functionality.
4. **Versioning:** Incremental versioning (e.g., `v0.1.0` → `v0.1.1`) documented via a comprehensive Changelog.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Interactive Demo

The easiest way to explore **DataWise** is through our interactive Google Colab notebook. You can see the engine in action with the Titanic dataset, including memory optimization and automated preprocessing.

Alternatively, you can access the file `datawise_Quickstart_v1.ipynb` directly for a quick preview..

## 🚀 Installation (Developer Mode)

To use **DataWise** in your local projects while staying synchronized with the source code:

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/starpie-16/ml-prep-box.git](https://github.com/starpie-16/ml-prep-box.git)
cd ml-prep-box
pip install -e .
```

## 📊 Performance Showcase
Here is a glimpse of what DataWise can do (Results from our Titanic benchmark):


**1. Memory Optimization**

By automatically downcasting data types, we achieved significant memory reduction:
* Before: 0.27 MB
* After: 0.24 MB
* Efficiency: ~11% reduction (even on tiny datasets!)



**2. Automated Strategy Suggestion**

The engine analyzes your data and suggests the most robust strategies:
